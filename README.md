# fake-bill-detection
Detection of counterfeit bills using machine learning models in Python.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect counterfeit bills. Using Python, the project applies various classification algorithms, including logistic regression, to differentiate between real and fake banknotes based on their physical properties. The goal is to demonstrate skills in predictive analysis, regression models, and data partitioning.

## Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**: The Python notebook containing the entire workflow from data cleaning, feature engineering, to model creation and evaluation.
2. **Presentation (PPT)**: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the findings, the model's performance, and recommendations for its use in real-world applications.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/laraS17/fake-bill-detection.git
